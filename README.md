# HTML Notes

## 📜 Adding JavaScript Files

In HTML, there are multiple ways to add JavaScript files. Each method has its unique use cases, benefits, and drawbacks:

### 1. **Adding JavaScript in the `<head>` Section**
- **Analogy:** Adding JavaScript in the `<head>` is like having the script and actors ready before the audience enters the theater. 
- **Explanation:** The browser loads the JavaScript file before rendering any of the HTML content, ensuring that the script is ready to use before the page loads.
- **Pros:** Ensures that the script is loaded before any user interaction happens.
- **Cons:** This can delay the loading of the visible content, making the user wait longer.
- **Example:**
    ```html
    <head>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </head>
    ```

### 2. **Adding JavaScript Before the `</body>` Tag**
- **Analogy:** Adding JavaScript before the `</body>` tag is like letting the audience in first and preparing the play (JavaScript) in the background. The show can start as soon as everyone is seated.
- **Explanation:** Here, the HTML content is loaded first, and then the JavaScript file is executed, making the page load faster for the user.
- **Pros:** Improves user experience by allowing content to appear quickly.
- **Cons:** If the script is essential for rendering the initial content, there might be a delay in functionality until the script is loaded.
- **Example:**
    ```html
    <body>
        <!-- HTML content -->
        <script src="script.js"></script>
    </body>
    ```

### 3. **Using the `defer` Attribute in the `<head>` Section**
- **Usage:** The `defer` attribute is used when adding the JavaScript file in the `<head>` section. It instructs the browser to download the JavaScript file in parallel with the HTML parsing but only execute it after the HTML is fully loaded.
- **Analogy:** Using the `defer` attribute is like preparing the play's background setup while the audience settles in, ensuring the play starts seamlessly once the audience is ready.
- **Pros:** Allows for both the HTML and JavaScript to load simultaneously without blocking the page rendering, making the load time faster and improving user experience.
- **Cons:** It might not be ideal for scripts that need to run immediately before the HTML content is fully parsed.
- **Example:**
    ```html
    <head>
        <script src="script.js" defer></script>
    </head>
    ```

## 📝 Summary
- **Adding JS in `<head>`:**
  - Loads the script before rendering any HTML content.
  - Ensures the script is ready but may slow down the page load.
- **Adding JS before `</body>`:**
  - Loads HTML content first, then executes the script.
  - Improves user experience by allowing content to appear quickly.
- **Using `defer` Attribute in `<head>`:**
  - Downloads JS file in parallel with HTML parsing.
  - Executes after HTML is fully loaded, balancing speed and performance.

## 🧠 Mind Map
1. **Adding JavaScript in `<head>` Section:**
   - Script loaded before HTML content.
   - Pros: Ensures script readiness.
   - Cons: May delay visible content load.
2. **Adding JavaScript Before `</body>` Tag:**
   - Script loaded after HTML content.
   - Pros: Faster initial content display.
   - Cons: Delayed execution of script functions.
3. **Using `defer` Attribute in `<head>` Section:**
   - Script downloaded in parallel and executed after HTML load.
   - Pros: Improved load time and user experience.
   - Cons: Not suitable for scripts needing immediate execution.

# 🚀 Async-Await Functions and Promises

## 📌 Async-Await in JavaScript
Async-Await simplifies working with promises and asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

### 🌟 **Async Function**
- Declares a function as asynchronous.
- Automatically returns a promise.

### ⏳ **Await Keyword**
- Pauses execution until the promise resolves.
- Stores resolved future objects for synchronous-like behavior.

### 🔧 **Real-World Uses**
- **Fetching API Data:** Handles responses seamlessly.
- **User Authentication:** Waits for server responses.
- **Reading Files:** Pauses until file read is completed.

## ⚠️ Error Handling in Promises
Handling errors effectively ensures smoother user experience.

### ❌ **Causes**
- **Network Error:** When the server is unreachable.
- **Invalid URL:** Due to malformed or incorrect URLs.

### 🛠️ **Error Handling**
- Use `.catch()` for promises.
- Use `try-catch` blocks for async-await functions.

### 💡 **Techniques**
- **Retry Mechanism:** Automatically retry failed requests.
- **User-Friendly Error Messages:** Show meaningful messages to users.
- **Fallback Data:** Use defaults or cached data for reliability.

### 🔧 **Real-World Uses**
- **Weather App:** Provide fallback forecasts during errors.
- **E-Commerce:** Retry fetching product details.
- **Login System:** Display connection issue messages.

---

## ✅ `response.ok`
The `response.ok` property determines the success of a fetch operation.

### 🛠️ **Tasks**
- **True:** Indicates a successful response (status 200–299).
- **False:** Indicates an unsuccessful response (e.g., 404, 500).

### 📚 **Common Uses**
- **API Rate Limiting:** Handle status `429 Too Many Requests`.
- **Authentication:** Detect status `401 Unauthorized`.
- **Server Errors:** Log or notify for `500 Internal Server Error`.

### 🔧 **Error Handling**
- Throw an error for a `false` status.
- Use `.catch()` or `try-catch` to handle errors.

## 🌐 `fetch` Returns a Promise
The `fetch()` function simplifies making HTTP requests by returning a promise.

### ⚙️ **Promise Behavior**
- **Resolves:** On success, returns a `Response` object.
- **Rejects:** On failure, throws a `TypeError` (e.g., network issues).

### 📚 **Common Uses**
- **Weather Data:** Fetch forecasts from APIs.
- **User Profiles:** Load user details dynamically.
- **Form Submission:** Send form data to a server.

### 🔧 **Error Handling**
- Check `response.ok` for HTTP errors.
- Use `.catch()` to manage network issues.

## 📖 Summary of await keyword
- **`await`** is used wherever a promise needs to be resolved to access its value.  
- Fetching (`fetch`) and parsing (`response.json()`) are separate asynchronous operations, each requiring `await`.  
- You don't need `await` for properties or methods that are synchronous.
